# blog

A static blog generator written in J using [md]().

## Installation

Install md and clone this repo.

## Usage

Create a folder to contain the blog files.

Within this, create a Markdown source directory.

Process this source into HTML by running `jconsole /path/to/run.ijs md` where
`md` is the name of the markdown source directory.

This will create an output directory called `_html` and containing the HTML
files.
